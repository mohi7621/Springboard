For the components, ""SPH"" refers to space heating, ""WTH"" refers to water heating, ""COL"" refers to air conditioning, ""RFG"" refers to refrigerators, and ""OTH"" refers to all other purposes. For the mathematical form, a variable is either ""B"", part of a base term , or ""A"", part of an adjustment term. For example, AIRCOND has a value of ""COL_B"" in the Electricity column, which means AIRCOND is included in a base term for the air conditioning component of the electricity end-use model.
